## project description

Code for white et al 2024. 

Script to calculate functional andcompositional stability metrics & consumer contributions to stability in response to multiple stressors, nutrient enrichment and sedimentation (fig2) and compare observed contributions to stability under combined nutrient enrichment and sedimentation to those predicted from the additive combination of the individual disturbances acting in isolation:
